colums are attribute

tuple = rows or records 

table is called entity

MONGO DB SUPPORT JSON and BSON.

with help of object id we can recognise with table.

in mongo db data types having 2 extra DATA TYPES.

       1)timeStamp
       2)machine id
       3)object id. =>primary key - inbuild.
                    =>12bytes - hexa decimal charecters.

BSON ->
     means binary object notation.
     -all the values are consideres by binary.its machine understanding   
     -execution is fast compr than JSON ,cos its binary dats 


    default user name of mysql= root and password is e=empty password
    in mongodb = username = user , password = empty password.

creating data base is ,axtually use "use" keyword in front of database name =like ;- use skillsafai 

there are many dta types = int,char,float,double ..ets 
 each have some memorys.  ....bytes=8bites      ,int=4 bytes , double=8bytes , long= 4bytes 

 (X) insert =>inject our query
     upsert  =>combination update and insert our quary

when adding new columns we use set proprty


we can add one column useing $set ,

if we want to increment of some values,  we have to use  $inc
